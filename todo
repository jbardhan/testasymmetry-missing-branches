DONE 0. for makeBemYoonDiel, verify convergence to Born if alpha = 0

**** This is testYoonDielConvergenceBorn.

DONE 1. for makeBemYoonDiel, verify convergence to Kirkwood if alpha = 0

This is testYoonDielConvergenceKirkwood.

DONE 2. verify both EcfQual and YoonDiel converge to the same answer if alpha = 0

**** Both testYoonDielConvergenceBorn and
     testYoonDielConvergenceKirkwood show this in their plots.

CHECK 3. verify both EcfQual and YoonDiel converge to the same answer if alpha != 0

**** Both converge to their Richardson extrapolated values at the
     appropriate rates (as Npanels to the -0.5).

**** However, the +1 charge extrapolations for the two measures
     deviate by 0.5 kcal/mol.  For a symmetric model, the
     extrapolations differ by 0.05 kcal/mol, an order of magnitude
     less deviation.  I suspect that one reason is the use of the
     hypersingular operator.  Not sure how to test this, other than to
     substitute all of their analytical eigenvalues.  That would be
     suggestive but not definitive.

4. implement panelBem for asymmetric EcfQual and YoonDiel

6. re-parameterize for YoonDiel/ecfQual panelBem and verify first-asym paper results

7. implement YoonLPB and verify convergence to Kirkwood if alpha = 0, kappa -> 0

8. verify YoonLPB converges to right answer for alpha=0, alpha!= 0 if kappa->0

9. implement panelBem for asymmetric YoonLPB

10. implement SternLPB pointBem and verify ddG as kappa -> 0 if alpha = 0

11. implement panelBem for SternLPB and verify convergence 

12. implement twoSoluteStern and verify convergence.

13. move Richardson extrapolation routines to pointbem/panelbem.
Also, write a routine that establishes the rate of convergence.
