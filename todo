DONE 0. for makeBemYoonDiel, verify convergence to Born if alpha = 0

**** This is testYoonDielConvergenceBorn.

1. for makeBemYoonDiel, verify convergence to Kirkwood if alpha = 0

This is testYoonDielConvergenceKirkwood.

2. verify both EcfQual and YoonDiel converge to the same answer if alpha = 0

**** Both testYoonDielConvergenceBorn and testYoonDielConvergenceKirkwood show this in their plots.
