tds_calc_vs_expt shows SLIC predictions vs. experimental data
tds_calc_vs_expt_slic_wo_ion_no_alkanols shows SLIC predictions vs. experimental data where alkanols (linear and cyclic alcohols) and secondary amine results are excluded (consistent poor performance of SLIC in predicting solvation entropies of these specific chemical groups)
